I write software at Google for a living, and also at home for fun. Co-founded [Heval AI](https://www.heval.ai/) to help SMB finance leverage AI advancements.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/anthonyvd), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/600591/anthonyvd), or [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/anthonyvd). If you want to get in touch, drop me an email at <a href='mailto:contact@anthonyvd.com'>contact@anthonyvd.com</a>. My resume is also available [here](/resume).

In my spare time, I'm also a wine enthusiast and sake nerd (WSET 3 in wines and sake, passed Sake Scholar Course). I co-founded [Agence Koji](https://agencekoji.com/) to connect artisan sake brewers with Quebecois. We represent 4 exceptional sake producers.
